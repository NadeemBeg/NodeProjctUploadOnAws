Backend Deployment to AWS

Step 1:  Launch a Windows or Linux Server Amazon EC2 instance.
 * Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at   
  https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
* Choose EC2 Dashboard, and then choose Launch instance.
* Choose the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) as per your requirement. 
* Choose an instance type 
* On the Configure Instance Details page, (Network, Subnet, Auto-assign Public  IP)
* Choose Next: Add Storage.
* On the Add Storage page, keep the default values and choose Next: Add Tags.
* On the Add Tags page, choose Add Tag, then enter Name for Key and enter like web-server-name for Value.
* Choose Next: Configure Security Group.
* Choose Review and Launch.
* On the Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair page, choose Create a new key pair and set Key pair name to web-server-key-pair. Choose Download Key Pair, and then save the key pair file on your local machine. You use this key pair file to connect to your EC2 instance.  
Step 2:  To connect to your EC2 instance and install the Apache web server & node as per your requirement 
For Apache & node

Note:- If you not enable ASG (Auto scaling Group ) then you should always associate your instance with EIP (Elastic Internet Protocol )
•	An Elastic IP address is static; it does not change over time.
•	To use an Elastic IP address, you first allocate one to your account, and then associate it with your instance or a network interface
Step 3:  Create a Hosted Zone for our domain
To create a hosted zone:
1.	Open the Amazon Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/
2.	Click Hosted Zones in the navigation pane.
3.	Click Create Hosted Zone.
4.	In Domain Name, enter domain name.
5.	Click Create.
Now, we can see new NS records from aws, and we want to copy it over to our current DNS provider's records.
•	Now go to your domain name provider platform access your domain and change name server .
•	Again come back on aws route 53 
•	Create require records specially A Record
  Step 4:  Upload your code on server via FTP
•	Connect  your server using  .pem file 
•	Before uploading data on server Give permission to user particular  location(directory) for current users
 Step 5 : Install npm all packages which are used in our project
Ex - npm i express
npm i <package name>
npm start or node index.js or nodemon index.js
